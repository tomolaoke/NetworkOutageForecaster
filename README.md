# Network Outage Forecaster
This project was created as a contribution and our entry for the LabLab.ai Hcakaton for Ai Connectivity.

Network Outage Forecaster is an AI-powered Python application designed to predict network outages using weather data. 
The project provides proactive alerts to underserved areas, schools, and organizations, helping them prepare for potential connectivity disruptions. 
Inspired by the recent Los Angeles wildfire outages, this tool aims to bridge digital accessibility gaps.

## Features
- **AI-Powered Predictions:** Leverages machine learning to analyze weather data and predict network outages.
- **Proactive Alerts:** Sends timely notifications to schools and underserved communities.
- **Data Integration:** Uses weather APIs and historical outage data for accurate forecasting.
- **Scalability:** Built for both small-scale local use and large-scale deployments.
